"""Minimum discharge output (min_output_w) — cross-mode conformance + lifecycle.

The minimum-discharge floor keeps the microinverter engaged above its idle
threshold so it responds instantly instead of going through the
grid-reconnect/soft-restart delay. Scoped to the HUB/AIO device family.

Two behaviours live here:

1. Steady-state conformance (CSV-driven, ``data/min_output.csv``): the floor
   holds discharge commands at min_output in discharge modes, never engages
   the battery in battery-preserving modes, and changes nothing when demand
   is already above the floor.

2. Command-assertion lifecycle tests: ``awake`` follows the manager's power
   direction, so a discharge command right after boot (cold start) engages
   the floor, and the stop-discharge calls inside a charge period never do.
